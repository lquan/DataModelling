	abstract = "{10.1093/biomet/80.1.27 SUMMARY It is shown how, in regular parametric problems, the first-order term is removed from the asymptotic bias of maximum likelihood estimates by a suitable modification of the score function. In exponential families with canonical parameterization the effect is to penalize the likelihood by the Jeffreys invariant prior. In binomial logistic models, Poisson log linear models and certain other generalized linear models, the Jeffreys prior penalty function can be imposed in standard regression software using a scheme of iterative adjustments to the data.}",

	abstract = "{Multivariate Statistical Simulation Mark E. Johnson For the researcher instatistics, probability, and operations research involved in the design andexecution of a computer-aided simulation study utilizing continuousmultivariate distributions, this book considers the properties of suchdistributions from a unique perspective. With enhancing graphics (three-dimensional and contour plots), it presents generation algorithms revealingfeatures of the distribution undisclosed in preliminary algebraicmanipulations. Well-known multivariate distributions covered include normalmixtures, elliptically assymmetric, Johnson translation, Khintine, and Burr-Pareto-logistic. 1987 (0 471-82290-6) 230 pp. Aspects of MultivariateStatistical Theory Robb J. Muirhead A classical mathematical treatment of thetechniques, distributions, and inferences based on the multivariate normaldistributions. The main focus is on distribution theory—both exact andasymptotic. Introduces three main areas of current activity overlooked orinadequately covered in existing texts: noncentral distribution theory,decision theoretic estimation of the parameters of a multivariate normaldistribution, and the uses of spherical and elliptical distributions inmultivariate analysis. 1982 (0 471-09442-0) 673 pp. Multivariate ObservationsG. A. F. Seber This up-to-date, comprehensive sourcebook treats data-orientedtechniques and classical methods. It concerns the external analysis ofdifferences among objects, and the internal analysis of how the variablesmeasured relate to one another within objects. The scope ranges from thepractical problems of graphically representing high dimensional data to thetheoretical problems relating to matrices of random variables. 1984 (0471-88104-X) 686 pp.}",
