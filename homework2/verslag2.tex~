\section{Introduction}
We analyze the \emph{autos} dataset of the UCI Machine Learning Repository which can be found at \url{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/}.
We first give a short overview of the dataset and than discuss our analysis of the dataset.

\section{Conclusion}
Because of the high dimension of our dataset (even after our simplification), it was quite difficult to find a good regression model (curse of dimensionality). Techniques like PCA, PCR and PLS are good techniques for this problem and are reasonably efficient to compute. A major disadvantage is the interpretation of the transformed regressors.

For the general linear models, the variable selection was a problem. This was resolved using the stepwise regression method, which automatically selected a set of suitable regressors. This made the model easier to work with and to understand.

The data preprocessing step was very important: the non-normality of the data was solved using a power transformation (more specifically, a BoxCox transformation). This resulted in better models, but this made the data more difficult to understand.
